This JSON representation includes top-level distinctions necessary for modeling an IT organization using a systems thinking approach. Each category captures crucial elements such as technology infrastructure, human factors, security, and compliance. The metadata provides insights into the system's purpose and potential areas that might be neglected or problematic, including the system's boundaries, which are often hard to define in complex IT environments.
